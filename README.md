# G7Frontend
A custom emulation frontend made with HTML5 and NodeJS. Used for G7OS. (WIP)
## Why create a custom frontend?
This was done to ensure a custom look for G7OS and all HTPCs that use it. Not all is done however.

## Cool App Bro. How do I install it?
Just clone the repo, cd into it, and run the following:

```chmod +x ./install.sh```

```./install.sh```

That's it. Nothing much to it. To launch it, just type the following:

```g7frontend```
