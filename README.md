# G7Frontend
A custom emulation frontend made with HTML5 and NodeJS. Used for G7OS. (WIP)
## Why create a custom frontend?
This was done to ensure a custom look for G7OS and all HTPCs that use it. Not all is done however.

[ ] Upload First files
[ ] Get Steam Support
[ ] First Emulator support (Dolphin, NES, SNES)
[ ] TV Support
[ ] Basic API Support
[ ] Full API for Apps
[ ] Finish Emulator Support
