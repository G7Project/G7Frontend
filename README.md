# G7Frontend
A custom emulation frontend made with HTML5 and NodeJS. Used for G7OS. (WIP)
## Why create a custom frontend?
This was done to ensure a custom look for G7OS and all HTPCs that use it. Not all is done however.
## Why did this get forked?
I just forked it to work on this program on my own time. I will setup a pull request soon.
## Credits
- Linux Team and the Arch Linux team for bringing such an amazing OS that I use for this project (archlinux.org)
- Google for the Material Icons and Open Sans (fonts.google.com)
- NodeJS for providing an amazing backend
