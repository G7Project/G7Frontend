# G7Frontend
A custom emulation frontend made with HTML5 and NodeJS. Used for G7OS. (WIP)
## Why create a custom frontend?
This was done to ensure a custom look for G7OS and all HTPCs that use it. Not all is done however.
*Update 1:* Well, I can't launch apps yet but this is coming along. Just need to start adding basic launch scripts and game searchers!
## Credits
